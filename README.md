## üß† Context of the Project

As a software engineer with a specialization in backend development, I created this project to challenge myself and grow in several key areas. My primary goal was to strengthen my frontend development skills by building a complete user interface using modern tools and best practices.

At the same time, I used this opportunity to deepen my backend expertise‚Äîexploring advanced database querying, implementing secure payment portals (Stripe and PayPal), and integrating an OTP system for sensitive user operations. This project also gave me hands-on experience with DevOps practices, including containerization with Docker and CI/CD workflows via GitHub Actions.

Building **AutoDream** has pushed me beyond my comfort zone, especially on the frontend, and significantly improved my development capabilities. As I continue to refine my skills through future personal projects, I plan to revisit and enhance this application with the goal of eventually launching it as a fully functional, production-ready eCommerce platform.
